- **Commands**: Type the first few characters of a command and press `Tab` twice to see a list of available commands starting with those characters.
- **Options and Arguments**: After typing a command, press `Tab` to see available options and arguments for that command.

Experiment with tab completion to speed up your workflow and reduce typing effort!
